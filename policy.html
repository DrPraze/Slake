<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2><p>Like most website operators, Slakenet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Slakenet's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Slakenet's visitors use its website. From time to time, Slakenet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Slakenet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://drpraze.github.io blog posts. Slakenet only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Certain visitors to Slakenet's websites choose to interact with Slakenet in ways that require Slakenet to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Slakenet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at http://drpraze.github.io to provide a username and email address.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2><p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Ads">4. Advertisements</h2><p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Slakenet and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="ExternalLinks">5. Links To External Sites</h2><p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms of service of every site you visit.</p>
<p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="PIIProtection">6. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2><p>Slakenet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Slakenet's behalf or to provide services available at Slakenet's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Slakenet's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Slakenet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Slakenet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Slakenet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Slakenet, third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>If you are a registered user of http://drpraze.github.io and have supplied your email address, Slakenet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Slakenet and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Slakenet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Stats">7. Aggregated Statistics</h2><p>Slakenet may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Slakenet may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Slakenet does not disclose your personally-identifying information.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Affiliates">8. Affiliate Disclosure</h2><p>This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your purchases or the price you may pay.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Cookies">9. Cookies</h2><p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Slakenet uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.</p>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Slakenet uses cookies to help Slakenet identify and track visitors, their usage of http://drpraze.github.io, and their website access preferences. Slakenet visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Slakenet's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Slakenet's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to Slakenet's use of cookies.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Ecommerce">10. E-commerce</h2><p>Those who engage in transactions with Slakenet â€“ by purchasing Slakenet's services or products, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Slakenet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Slakenet. Slakenet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<p><a href="#tableofcontents">Back to table of contents</a></p><h2 id="Changes">11. Privacy Policy Changes</h2><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Slakenet may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Slakenet's sole discretion. Slakenet encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
